Phase 0: Basics
	- Design arch is defined
		○ FSM
		○ Contract between modules
		○ Unit testing defined
		○ Debuggability defined
	- Infrastructure is in place
		○ Sharable using GIT
		○ IDE is defined
		○ UML plugin
	- Atleast one module is functional using the design arch
	- Data sharing is possible between modules.

Phase 2: Offline
	- All offline calculators are functional (list in a separate doc).
	- Create an overarching set of 'features' that aggregate the various calculations in one place.

Phase 03: Online 
	- Parse Redfin and Zillow URLs (replace manual input with URL input).
	- Excel plugin is functional
		
Phase 04: Complete package
	- Add web crawlers for Redfin/Zillow. There are some crawlers implemented (https://github.com/wangff/RedfinCrawler) in the open source world, but they don't conform to the arch defined here. 
	- Identify the other sites and design and implement parsers for them too.
	- Start storing daily parsing done (csv/xlsx) by the bot to the cloud.

Later phase:
	- Make the app for a consumer. Package it via a website. 
	- Make it scalable by having a server, even if at home.
	- Design simplicity.
		○ General UI should be clean.
		○ Design and implement rent calculations.
		○ Design suggestions if a number is unknown. See if this can be filled with the tool.

Future enhancements:
	- Implement an Android app using website as a backend. 
	- Implement ML and AI w.r.t. analysis of properties on real estate sites.
	- Plug in MLS sites too (if possible).
	- Get feedback from established realtors/investors. 
	- Listen to feedback from general users.
